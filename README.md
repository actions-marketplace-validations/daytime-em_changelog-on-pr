# Changelog on Release PRs
Supports workflows where release branches are merged into master by adding
release notes to opened pull requests. The release notes are generated from the first line of each commit in the PR.
Technically this could be applied to any branch, but probably makes the most sense in worflows where a pull request is merged as part of the release process.
